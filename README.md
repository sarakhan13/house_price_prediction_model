House Price Prediction model determines the price of a house when provided with one or more parameters. 
The project uses the following dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shree1992/housedata?datasetId=46927, to train the following regression models:

1. Simple Linear Regression: Predicts price of a house on the basis of sq feet living. 

2. Multiple Linear Regression: Predicts price of a house on various parameters: Number of bedrooms, number of baths, sq feet living, sq feet loft, 
floor level, waterfront, view, condition, sq feet above, sq feet of basemenet, year it was built in, year it was renovated, name of city and year it is available. 

3. Polynomial Regression: Predicts price of a house on the basis of sq feet living and determines whether the data is linear or non-linear. 

4. Support Vectore Regression: Predicts price of a house on various parameters: Number of bedrooms, number of baths, sq feet living, sq feet loft, 
floor level, waterfront, view, condition, sq feet above, sq feet of basemenet, year it was built in, year it was renovated, name of city and year it is available. 

5. Decision Tree Regression: Predicts price of a house on various parameters: Number of bedrooms, number of baths, sq feet living, sq feet loft, 
floor level, waterfront, view, condition, sq feet above, sq feet of basemenet, year it was built in, year it was renovated, name of city and year it is available. 

6. Random Forest Regression: Predicts price of a house on various parameters: Number of bedrooms, number of baths, sq feet living, sq feet loft, 
floor level, waterfront, view, condition, sq feet above, sq feet of basemenet, year it was built in, year it was renovated, name of city and year it is available.
